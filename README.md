# Hangman_final_submission
Final submission of hangman code for Trexquant GAR
## Core Idea: Word Length Differentiation
 ### The primary strategy is to use different approaches based on word length:
 ### My strategy does the following differentiation:
 #### ● Short Words (6 characters or less):
 ##### ○ Relies on dictionary-based filtering
 ##### ○ Utilizes vowel priors based on length of the word
 ##### ○ Uses simple heuristics like vowel preference and frequency analysis
 #### ● Long Words(more than 6 characters):
 ##### ○ Leverages machine learning models
 ##### ○ Improves predictions for the ML methods using all the above methods
