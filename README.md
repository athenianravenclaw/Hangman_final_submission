# Hangman_final_submission
Final submission of hangman code for Trexquant GAR
Core Idea: WordLength Differentiation
 The primary strategy is to use different approaches based on word length:
 My strategy does the following differentiation:
 ● ShortWords (6 characters or less):
 ○ Relies on dictionary-based filtering
 ○ Utilizes vowel priors based on length of the word
 ○ Usessimple heuristics and frequency analysis
 ● LongWords(morethan 6 characters):
 ○ Leverages machine learning models
 ○ Improves predictions for the ML methods using all the above methods
